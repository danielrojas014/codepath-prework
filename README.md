**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Daniel Rojas**

Time spent: **5.5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/flicker-determined-pressure)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Changed font style and size of the text

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered in creating the submission for the pre-work memory game was not being deeply knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. It was something quite different for me because it is a little different from other programming languages I know like Python or Java. Though it was difficult at the beginning, I was able to overcome this challenge by researching during the project on how to do specific features that I wanted to implement to my memory game. By doing this, I was able to learn more about these three languages and be confident enough to add my own touch to the game to make it more original. Another challenge I faced was when I tried to generate a random pattern at the beginning of the game. At first, I put the for loop and outside of the startGame function, but then I realized that I was supposed to put it inside of the function. I then had to use the .length property to make the for loop the same size as the empty array of a specific length that I created. Despite the challenges I faced while creating the game, this experience helped me improve my skills in programming and web development, which could help me in the future.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am extremely interested in how web developers make web applications that require a lot of action from the user’s part. It must require many lines of code for the application to be as efficient as they usually are. One question that I have about web development is how …

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would have put low background music for the player to be entertained while he tries to put in the correct pattern of the buttons. In addition to that, I also would have liked to make the background of the application look more colorful by putting something like disco lights with distinct colors. Another feature I would have loved to put is for all the buttons to flash red repeatedly and make a “game over” sound effect when the player guessed the pattern wrong and show them what the correct pattern was right after that. Then make the buttons flash green repeatedly when the user won with a “winner” sound effect. Putting these features would have made the game even more interactive and enjoyable for the user.
